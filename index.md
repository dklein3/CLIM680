# CLIM680 Project

## David Klein

#### This project will examine variations in soil moisture with other climate parameters. The source of soil moisture data for this project is the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). The soil moisture data consists of monthly means of soil moisture in a 0.5 degree latitude and longitude grid. The soil moisture is reported in a water height equivalent in millimeters (mm). The data is model-calculated, not based on observations. The data can be found on the [CPC Website](https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cpcsoil.html).

#### The long term average soil moisture levels can be seen below (Fig 1). Low values are seen in arid areas such as the Sahara desert, Western Australia, and Antarctica. High values are seen in the tropical rainforests, as well as the temperate climates of Eastern North America, parts of Europe, Eastern China, and Japan.

#### Monthly climatology over the time period of the dataset (1948-2021) can be seen below (Fig 2). Significant monthly and seasonal variations are seen in the temperate climates, while
